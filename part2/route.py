#If the two points are near each other, for example in the same city, estimating the great circle with a straight line in the latitude-longitude space will produce minimal error, and be a lot faster to calculate. A minor complication is the fact that the length of a degree of longitude depends on the latitude: a degree of longitude spans 111km on the Equator, but half of that on 60Â° north. Adjusting for this is easy: multiply the longitude by the cosine of the latitude. Then you can just
# take the Euclidean distance between the two points, and multiply by the length of a degree:

    1. Your function should return a dictionary having the following keys:
        -"route-taken" : a list of pairs of the form (next-stop, segment-info), where
           next-stop is a string giving the next stop in the route, and segment-info is a free-form
           string containing information about the segment that will be displayed to the user.
           (segment-info is not inspected by the automatic testing program).
        -"total-segments": an integer indicating number of segments in the route-taken
        -"total-miles": a float indicating total number of miles in the route-taken
        -"total-hours": a float indicating total amount of time in the route-taken
        -"total-expected-accidents": a float indicating the expected accident count on the route taken
    2. Do not add any extra parameters to the get_route() function, or it will break our grading and testing code.
    3. Please do not use any global variables, as it may cause the testing code to fail.
    4. You can assume that all test cases will be solvable.
    5. The current code just returns a dummy solution.
